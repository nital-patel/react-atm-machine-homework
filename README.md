# Time Keeps on Ticking Ticking Ticking

Let's add an app to our React portfolio! Your old gym coach from high school, the guy who yelled at you and wore sweatpants to fancy occassions, reached out and is now a client. He understands that we live in a digital world, so he wants to modernize with a digital stopwatch!

But he's concerned about your ability to keep track of the tasks needed to build out the stopwatch...


### Assignment

Task: Build a react app which implements a stopwatch. 

**Requirements**:
* **Display**
* **Start button**
* **Stop button**
* **Reset button**

Let's get started as per usual `create-react-app <stop watch>`

Now decide how exactly you are going to hold state in your parent component
`App`. In general your state should be the minimum amount of information needed for your components. Do not hold *computed* values in your state (why, you ask?  [read this!(optional)](http://reactkungfu.com/2015/09/common-react-dot-js-mistakes-unneeded-state/)). You will also need to define a few methods, which you can pass to the buttons as props. You should have at least a `start`, `stop` and `reset` methods which will be fired by the buttons.

HINT: Use
[setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval)
to measure time. It is not precise in terms of time keeping but is
good enough for our purposes.
